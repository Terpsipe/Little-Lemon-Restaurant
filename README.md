# Little-Lemon-Restaurant
This project is part of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate offered by Coursera.

## Project Overview
The code currently presented showcases my work for part 4/9, "HTML and CSS in depth." This project is a reflection of my ongoing journey in web development. As I progress in the field, I plan to add more functionality to this project.

## Current state
Until now, my primary focus has been on the index.html. While the other pages have been created to already link them, they currently lack substantial functionality.

## Project Update
Start 02.02.2024 I'm trying to get a better grasp on plain JavaScript before in the near future implementing web pages using React framework. To this end, I'm in the process of adding functionality to the products- (and probably the reservations-) page using plain JS in combination with HTML and CSS.
