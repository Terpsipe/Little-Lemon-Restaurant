# Little-Lemon-Restaurant
This project is part of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate offered by Coursera.

## Project Overview
The code currently presented showcases my work for part 4/9, "HTML and CSS in depth." This project is a reflection of my ongoing journey in web development. As I progress in the field, I plan to add more functionality to this project.

## Current state
Until now, my primary focus has been on the index.html. While the other pages have been created to already link them, they currently lack substantial functionality.
