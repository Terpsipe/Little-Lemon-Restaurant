# Little-Lemon-Restaurant
This project is part of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate offered by Coursera.

## Project Overview
The code currently presented showcases my work for part 4/9, "HTML and CSS in depth." This project is a reflection of my ongoing journey in web development. As I progress in the field, I plan to add more functionality to this project.

## Current state
The index.html and its css have not been changed substantially since the last major update. Thus, it's not connected to the styles.css the other documents use to share common design elements (yet).
HTML and css documents for booking, contact and the products-page have been added, JavaScript will follow in the upcoming updates.

Currently, my priority lies in honing JS skills, thus the adjustments to media on the new pages will not be addressed at this time. 

## Project Update
Start 02.02.2024 I'm trying to get a better grasp on plain JavaScript before in the near future implementing web pages using React framework. To this end, I'm in the process of adding functionality to the products- (and probably the reservations-) page using plain JS in combination with HTML and CSS.
